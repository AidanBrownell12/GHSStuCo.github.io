<p>Go to <a href="https://ghsstuco.github.io/runoff.html" class="uri">https://ghsstuco.github.io/runoff.html</a>. Paste Google Sheets values into the first textbox (the values should be a grid of names where each row is a person's vote and each column is a different choice [first choice first column, second choice second column, etc...]); if you need to remove someone from the election, put their name in the second textbox. Then press the <code>Calculate!</code> button.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you're running an election between John, Jane, Bill, Bob, and Sue. One person ranks the candidates: 1. John, 2. Jane, 3. Bill, and 4. Bob; another person ranks the candidates: 1. John, 2. Bill; another person ranks the candidates 1. Jill; and the last person ranks the candidates 1. Bob, 2. Bill, 3. Jane, 4. John. Suppose that John drops out of the election (say for example this is a class president election, but John has already won the student body president election). Suppose that Sue also drops out of the election.</p>
<p>You would want to enter (probably by copying and pasting from a spreadsheet)</p>
<pre><code>John    Jane    Bill    Bob
John    Bill
Jill
Bob Bill    Jane    John</code></pre>
<p>into the first textbox.</p>
<p>You would also want to enter <code>John, Sue</code> in the second textbox.</p>
